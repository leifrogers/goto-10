# goto10

small recreation of the storied <a href="https://10print.org/">10 Print</a>

while the javascript is limited to one giant line, the html demanded formatting into a div with adjusted line-height, font-size.  microsoft edge seems to have major problems with this and there's quite some overlap.

working example can be found here <a href="https://leifrogers.github.io/goto-10/">leifrogers.github.io/goto-10/</a>
